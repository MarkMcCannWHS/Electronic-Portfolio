        <h3>Spanish Club</h3>
        <p>In the Spanish Club, I worked as our club's treasuer. As a treasurer, I worked with help from my class advisor to learn how to manage our club funds, interpret whether or not we can make a profit during fairs we have at our schools, and how to write receipts to give out to our club members. By learning these skills by being the Spanish Club treasurer, I learned to be fast, responsive, careful, and prepared.</p>

        <h3>Spanish Honor Society</h3>
        <p>In the Spanish Club, I participated in the society as a member whom was involved in many community service activities. Community service activities I have been involved in are bell ringing at walmart to raise funds for salvation army, clean up for safety fair, repaint sidewalks at Waipahu High school, and helped out with the African American festivial at Waipahu High School. By attending these services, I learned to be attentive, hardworking, energetic, and involved in my community.  </p>

        <h3>Tennis</h3>
        <p>I joined  Waipahu High School's tennis program in 2022. Previously, I played tennis with my family as a hobby, I was still a novice player, which made me be placed in 3rd dobules. However, when I entered my school's varsity team in my sophomore year, I improved a good amount as I could work with my double partners to win half of our games. Furthermore, for the 2023-2024, I still improved greatly and put all of my hard work in to win some of my games. By putting in my best efforts and by having a good character, I earned the Marauder award trophy for my hardwork and my character. In short, I learned how to be teachable, adaptable, and to push my limits. Also, the picture that is used for this caption is from a tennis game against Aiea.</p>
